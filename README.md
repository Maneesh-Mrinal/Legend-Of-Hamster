It is about a group of hamster that are denied their rights to good food. So, the protagonist, The Hamster, took it in his hands to get to food heaven and make his peers happy. They wanted to be sneaky so they took a different route to reach the Food Heaven, but little did they know the small insects and MONSTERS were deadlier than their masters. With our funny and goofy animations with a pixel art style we tried to deliver an absurd game involving the life of a hamster who takes small things too seriously. Hamster's are cute, funny and intimidating at time like u would encounter a few in our game. Enjoy the Game!
